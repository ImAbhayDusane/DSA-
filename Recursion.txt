Best Approach to Recursion
how to understand and approach a problem
i. identify if you can break down the problem into smaller problem
ii. form a recurrence relation if required
iii. draw the recursive tree
iv. About the tree
    i.  See the flow of function that how they are getting in stack
    ii. identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls
    iii. Draw the tree and pointer again and again and use a debugger
v. see how the value are return at each step ; see where the function call coming out ; at the end you will come out of main function

*************
variables
i) Argument
2) Return type
3) Body of function

Binary Search with Recursion
i. Comparing --> O(1)
ii. Dividing into two half
-----------------------
Recurrence Relation :-
F(N) = O(1) + F(N/2)
-----------------------

Types of Recurrence Relation:
i. Linear Recurrence Relation :- Fibonacci Numbers
ii. Divide And Conquer Relation :- Binary Search

important tips
do not overthink
