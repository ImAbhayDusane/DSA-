Equal roots :-
f(n) = 2f(n - 1) + f( n - 2)
f(n) = α^n
α^n = 2α^(n-1) + α^(n-2)
α^n - 2α^(n-1) - α^(n-2) = 0
divide by α^(n-2)
α^2 - 2α + 1 = 0  (α = 1 is double root)
General Case :- if α is repeated r times then α^n, nα^n, n^2α^n, ....., n ^ r -1 α^n are all solutions
hence i can take two root like 1,α^n

1, n α^n =  1, n
f(n) = c1 (1) ^ n + c2 n α^n
     = c1 + c2 n
f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1
f(1) = 1 + c1 + c2
c1 = 0
c2 = 1
f(n) = n
time complexity of above relation is f(n)
